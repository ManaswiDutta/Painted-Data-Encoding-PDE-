# Painted-Data-Encoding-PDE-
<p>PDE can transform string data and turn it into a pixel art. This can also be used to decrypt the string from a given pixel art</p>
<p>the code is now updated to hold upto any lenght of strings</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>run the encoder and enter your data to encode.... just run the decoder to decode</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>the RGB values of each pixel when treated as a 3 digit number can be converted to a 4 digit (64 base) number therefore each number pixel can hold upto 4 strings</p>


<h3>updates</h3>

<p>
the code can now deal with data of any lenght.  there is no limit....
