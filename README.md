# Painted-Data-Encoding-PDE-
<p>PDE can transform string data and turn it into a pixel art. This can also be used to decrypt the string from a given pixel art</p>
<p>the code is now updated to hold upto 82944 strings</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>run the encoder and enter your data to encode.... just run the decoder to decode</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>the RGB values of each pixel when treated as a 3 digit number can be converted to a 4 digit (64 base) number therefore each number pixel can hold upto 4 strings</p>


<h3>Limitations and future plans</h3>

<p>
As of now this code can only work with english alphabets and a few symbols. It can not encode numbers or spacial charecters yet. so in futuure , I have to make it unicode compatable to work with or even better if i can make it into a GUI.
